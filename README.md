# ⚡ Rumble enhancer ⚡

## About

Rumble enhacer is a chrome extension which replaces <a href="https://rumble.com">rumble.com</a>'s default page for a full fledged react app.

## Contribute

- Clone the project
- Use `yarn build` to generate the extension files
- Load a custom chrome extension directly from the applications root -> extension

# -

With the current setup you won't be able to just load local images because their addresses are
not currently translated to chrome-extension url.
So we'll be hard-coding the svg images we need for now and, probably, forever. Since there aren't enough images to justify the time spent adjusting vite and the deploy script for that
